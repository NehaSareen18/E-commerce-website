## Installation and Setup

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js and npm (or Yarn/pnpm) installed.
*   MongoDB installed and running.

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [project directory]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (Frontend):**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Frontend environment variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory.
    *   Add the following variables (replace with your actual values):

        ```
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000  # URL of your backend API
        # Add any other frontend specific environment variables here.
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies (Backend):**

    ```bash
    cd ../server  # Navigate back to the project root and then to server
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

5.  **Configure Backend environment variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
    *   Add the following variables (replace with your actual values):

        ```
        PORT=5000
        MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/[database_name]  # MongoDB connection string
        JWT_SECRET=[your_secret_key]  # Secret key for JWT
        # Add any other backend specific environment variables here.
        ```

6.  **Start the MongoDB server (if not already running):**

    ```bash
    mongod
    ```

7.  **Run the Backend:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run dev  # or node server.js  (depending on your package.json script)
    ```

8.  **Run the Frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm start # or yarn start or pnpm start
    ```

    The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your React configuration).
